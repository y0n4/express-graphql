This repo is strictly just server side to get some practice in GraphQL and Express.

In the project directory start off to install necessary dependencies:
### `npm install`

Then run on json server to access data:
### `npm run json:server`

To play with GraphiQL client (make queries and mutations):
### `npm run dev`

The data is a simple hardcoded information of people and what company they work at. The connection between "user" and "company" is bi-relational.
